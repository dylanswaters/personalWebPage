<h2>Biography</h2>
<p class="box">&emsp; Dylan Waters has been working with computers since his birth, when he learned to use Windows 96. Graduating from playing with MS-Paint, Dylan began trying to learn more about computers, and started down the road of living in a basement forever. Strongly believing in personal freedom, Dylan found himself attracted to <a href="https://opensource.org/" target="_blank">Open-source philosophy</a> and projects. Today, Dylan seeks to learn as much as he can about development and workings of computers.<br><br> &emsp; Dylan enjoys playing videogames, and with his dogs. He is constantly planning new adventures for his Dungeons and Dragons groups. He enjoys death metal <b> and </b> all other kinds of music, but is accused of being a Satanist anyway. He is a minimalist, and a devout follower of his heart who feels weird writing about himself in third person. His dream is to have a beard long enough to carry a cat around in it.<br><br> &emsp; Dylan aspires to work for an open-source organization or a non-profit, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>. Dylan's choice of Operating System is <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/" target="_blank">Arch Linux.</a> </p>
